"""Config inheritance across a system's stages: inherit, bake, and reload.

Each stage's config is the earlier stages' baked, top-level keys (stage
order, whole-key replacement, no deep merge), with the stage's own config on
top. The only persisted record of what a stage actually ran with is the
`<exp_dir>/config/<stage>.yaml` that stage's own run bakes; there is no
separate experiment-context file.

    """Earlier stages' configs, in stage order, then `own`'s keys on top.

    Walks `system_cls.stages` in declared order up to (not including)
    `stage`. For each earlier stage, its top-level keys come from
    `in_memory[stage_name]` when given (the same run's own keys, already
    resolved, before that stage has baked anything), else from
    `<exp_dir>/config/<stage_name>.yaml` when that file exists (a `--exp_dir`
    run inheriting from an earlier run). A later stage's keys win over an
    earlier one's, and `own` wins over all of them. The merge is
    whole-top-level-key replacement, not a deep merge: a key present in
    `own` always fully replaces the same key inherited from an earlier
    stage.

    Args:
        exp_dir: The experiment directory holding `config/<stage>.yaml`
            for earlier stages, or `None` when none of them has one (no
            `in_memory` entry and no baked file for any earlier stage).
        system_cls: The system class `stage` belongs to; its declared
            `stages` gives the inheritance order.
        stage: The stage about to run. Only stages declared before it are
            considered; `stage` itself contributes nothing inherited.
        own: This stage's own config (its default plus whatever the
            caller loaded), not yet merged with anything inherited.
        in_memory: Mapping from an earlier stage's name to its own
            top-level keys, already resolved, for a stage that has not
            (yet) baked a file this run. Checked before the baked file.

    Returns:
        DictConfig: A new config: earlier stages' keys (`in_memory` or
        baked file), then `own`'s own keys layered on top.
